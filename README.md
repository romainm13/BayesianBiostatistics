# BayesianBiostatistics

Tutor: [**Ulysse Herbach**](https://herbach.perso.math.cnrs.fr/) (research scientist at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en) in the [BIGS](https://www.inria.fr/en/bigs) project team, currently working on modeling and estimation of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) dynamics for detecting resistance to targeted therapies.)

### Topic: Statistical inference of gene networks from dynamic graphs

The approach used in this research project is to model gene interactions by graphs, whose structure will be determined by Bayesian inference. In order to obtain concrete results and to verify the soundness of the theory, we will implement codes in Python.
